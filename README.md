# Real-Time Face Management System (Simulation)



Overview

The Real-Time Face Management System is a simulated C++ application that allows users to manage a simple database of faces using binary patterns. Users can add, remove, search, and update face records in the system.

Features

Add New Face: Register a new face with a binary pattern.

Remove Face: Delete an existing face from the system.

Display Known Faces: View all stored faces along with their binary patterns.

Search Face by Name: Find a specific face in the system.

Update Face Pattern: Modify the binary pattern of a registered face.

Technologies Used

C++: Core programming language

Standard Library (STL): Utilizes vector and string for data management

I/O Stream: Handles user input and output

How to Run

Compile the code:

g++ face_management.cpp -o face_management

Run the executable:

./face_management

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.

Usage Instructions

When prompted, enter the corresponding number to select an option.

Input the required details for adding, removing, or updating faces.

Type 6 to exit the program.

Sample Input/Output

Real-Time Face Management System (Simulation)

Options:
1. Add New Face
2. Remove Face
3. Display Known Faces
4. Search Face by Name
5. Update Face Pattern
6. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter name for the new face: Charlie
Enter binary pattern for the new face (e.g., 1010011101): 111100001111
New face added: Charlie

Future Enhancements

Implement real facial recognition using OpenCV.

Store face data in a database instead of memory.

Enhance pattern matching for better face detection.
